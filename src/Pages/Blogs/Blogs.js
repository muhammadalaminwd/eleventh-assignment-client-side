        <h1 className='question'>Q2: Why should you use Node JS and when should you use Mongodb?</h1>
        <h4 className='answer mb-4'>Ans: We should use Node JS because it is one of the best JavaScript runtime for backend development. It has been designed to build scalable network applications. Its widely used especially in the U.S. in the start-up kingdom of Silicon Valley. We can use node js for both frontend and backend server side development. The benefit of using node js are open-source NPM repository, scalable systems, good performance, non-blocking, reusable code, time to market etc. So we use node js.
        <br />
        We should use Mongodb when we need high availability of data with automatic, fast and instant data recovery. Mongodb can be a solution for use want to grow big. It reduces our schema migration cost. If the most of our services are cloud-based, mongodb is the best suitable for us. After all we need to identify the project requirements and further goals to use mongodb.
